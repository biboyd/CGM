# Code Related to analyzing the CGM by creating Synthetic Spectra
using yt, trident and spectacle projects

**NOTE**: Absorber Extraction and Catalog creation should now be done using the [SALSA package](https://github.com/biboyd/salsa)


Begin using by running `pip install -e ./`
# Directory layout
## CGM
holds code to construct a python package that includes `absorber_extractor` and `absorber_plotter` classes that can extract absorbers from a simulation given trident lightrays. Also contains scripts for extracting distribution of absorbers and analyzing them as well as scripts seperate from that main class for visualizing simulation.  

### CGM/absorber_analysis
Scripts for creating plots of different absorption properties. Particularly for exploring as well as comparing different type of absorbers ie hot/cold or inflow/outflow.

### CGM/absorber_extraction_class
**NOTE**: This Code is deprecated. Use the [SALSA package](https://github.com/biboyd/salsa) to do any absorber extraction
This contains the code for the `absorber_extractor` which can extract absorbers from a trident lightray using either spectacle to fit spectra or the "ICE Method" which uses an algorithm to find the absorbers directly from the number density along the lightray. 

### CGM/catalog 
Code using SALSA to generate catalog of absorbers for a given Ion and Snap shot

### CGM/comparison_code 
A script comparing the results of different algorithms for extracting absorbers directly from lightray

### CGM/extract_sample_absorbers
**NOTE**: This Code is deprecated. Use the [SALSA package](https://github.com/biboyd/salsa) to do any absorber extraction. Lightray generation can also be found in SALSA package and is more up to date there.

Scripts to construct lightrays and then extract absorbers from those lightrays. One creates a uniform "scan" of the galaxy which can then be constructed into a movie. The other creates a random distribution of lightrays which then can be used to find a distribution of absorbers that can be compared to observational studies. Cuts can be made to the dataset before extracting absorbers which allows to study different type of absorbers.

### CGM/general_utils
Contains some scripts/functions that different scripts all use. Additionally `filter_definitions.py` contains different dictionaries with default values that are used by different scripts

### CGM/notebooks
notebook to explain how to use the `absorber_extractor`/`absorber_plotter` classes. (Currently very out of date)

### CGM/visualize_gal
Scripts for visualizing the galaxy. `create_slices` creates slices going through the galaxy as well as a density projection face on. `create_rot_frames` creates a series of projection of the galaxy at different angles so they can be combined into a movie that effectively rotates the galaxy and give a good 3d representation.

## multi_plot_movie
Holds code for a multiplot class that uses yt and trident. It's purpose is to construct a multiplot that shows a light ray traveling through a galactic simulation, it's corresponding number density along its length (for a given ion), and the resulting spectra an observer would see.  
* main file is multi_plot.py (holds relavent classe).   
* construct_rays.py holds code for making the rays used in the movie making  
* capture_movie_frames.py hold code for running the jobs to make the movie.   
Also holds center_finder.py which reads/records the center, orientation, rshift, and bulk velocity for each galaxy  

## job_scripts
scripts for submitting jobs to slurm   

## polar_dependence
Code for looking at the relation between column density and polar angle
from axis of galaxy. (likely deprecated) 

## bash_scripts
* scripts for making movies (combining frames) and for editing movies (combining side by side etc.)  
* scripts for checking num frames/rays already made. helpful to figure out if/what jobs failed
